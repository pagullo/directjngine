# What is DirectJNgine? #

_DirectJNgine_ (or _DJN_, for short), is a Java based implementation of the [Ext Direct API](http://extjs.com/blog/2009/05/13/introducing-ext-direct/) for [ExtJs](http://extjs.com).

_ExtJs_ is probably one of the most _powerful and attractive UIs_ for web-based applications, as can be seen [here](http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/desktop/desktop.html), as well as in many other [examples](http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/). _DirectJNgine_ makes it much easier to use the full power of Java business classes with such a powerful front-end, making Java methods _directly callable from the client_.

_DirectJNgine_ is fully feature complete, providing support for all kinds of requests: batched json requests, form posts with file uploads, requests from polling providers, etc.

A detailed _User's Guide_ (more than 40 pages) is part of the distribution. Besides, it runs all of Ext Direct examples distributed with _ExtJs_, located in _examples/direct_, and additional demos are included and discussed in the _User's Guide_.

_DirectJNgine_ is extensively tested, passing more than 140 automated tests for all supported web browsers (see the list below).

For further info, take a look at the _User's Guide_.
